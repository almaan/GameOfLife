# Toy C++ Implementation of Conway's Game of Life


## What 
This repo holds a simple implementation of Conway's game of life, created for
the sake of learning and brushing up some rusty C++ skills. It's _largely_
inspired by the Rosetta code found
[here](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life#C.2B.2B), but with
some modifications:

* Use single a 3D array for switching between worlds rather than two 2D arrays
* Animated output (yay!)
* User input to setup the system

## Example

![example](imgs/ex.gif)

## Todo
* Add more initial states
* Add ability to combine components (e.g., glider, slider) into one initial state
* Colors?
